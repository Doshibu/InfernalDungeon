*Simulator survival mode of severals especies against a unique monster.*

The main object of the project is the simulation of a survival game in a dungeon. 
A monster strolling in a castle is looking for unwary visitors. 
The program graphically simulates the environment of the dungeon, the behavior of the monster 
(which is not very clever, and has a given behavior).

The whole game is in French but is intuitive enough to be understood by anyone.

## How to play ?  :running:

### Environment settings
*First of all, you must specify the configuration of the environment in which the monster 
and other available characters will evolve.*

You can choose :
- The dimensions of the map, the dungeon
- The number of obstacles present according to their type
- The number of characters present according to their type
- What type of monster will be represented

### During the simulation
* While is the game is running, two window are opened. One for the environment and another 
reporting details of the current simulation.

You can see :
- Number of steps
- Monster Health
- Character Life Points

###Bonus  :sunglasses:  :fries: !###
You can directly act on the simulation running acting on :
- Simulation speed
- "Step by step" mode
- "Normal" mode
